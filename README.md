## Quick start
- Go to orthrus_v1 folder and choose to open .ipynb files in Colab
- A Github account will be needed for authorisation. Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and get one if you haven't >_< 

## Documentation
- under construction but please see Notebooks' annotations

## FAQ
1. Do I need a Google Colab subscription?<br>Without any Colab+, general CPU runtime, T4 GPU, and TPU should still be accessible.
2. Do I need a Google account? <br> May make life easier. Colab can also access files in your Google drive (with permission).
3. Help! Still unsure how to walk Orthrus. <br> Open an issue or get in touch with me (preprint link)
