## FAQs
1. Do I need a Google Colab subscription?<br>Without any Colab+, general CPU runtime, T4 GPU, and TPU should still be accessible.
2. Do I need a Google account? <br> May make life easier. Colab can also access files in your Google drive (with permission).
3. Help! Still unsure how to use Orthrus? <br> Open an issue or get in touch with me ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.15.623814v1))
